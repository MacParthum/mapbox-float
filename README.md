## Mapbox Float Template
I wanted to try to understand mapbox and how I can actually use it in a webpage.  Theres a ton of tutorials out there but they all just show you how create big div on a full page.  I took a look at https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/ and then set about creating a simple template to actually use mapbox on a website.

### What the heck was I doing?

Just some notes for myself in the future... I took the code from mapbox docs and created a css float layout and added a mapbox div that is associated in the float-style and style.css.  I took the inline JavaScript in the HTML code they give you in the docs file (see above link) and created a mabox.js file so the index.html file is pure HTML. Now if I want to make more complicated maps or a working site in the future I can just modify the JavaScript/CSS/HTML seperately.
